# Escape Room

This is a fun little text game I built mostly through simple logic patterns in Python.  

You can play the game here: https://repl.it/@wswalker/EscapeRoom

*Technical Overview*

From a technical perspective, the game largely makes use of:
* If/elif/else statements based on user input
* While/for loops (the whole game is one giant While loop)
* Lists/Dictionaries which dynamically update as needed

*Creative Overview*

As a big fan of escape rooms, I really enjoyed coding this.  Although I initially tried to make it a route, standard, highly structured escape room game, I decided, instead, to parody the usual escape room tropes.  The player is often rewarded by subverting the game's expectations and I've gone to considerable lengths to ensure the game will still function despite the player thinking divergently.
