# Los Angeles Parking Tickets

Lacity.org offers a [public data set](https://data.lacity.org/A-Well-Run-City/Parking-Citations/wjz9-h9np) of Los Angeles parking tickets.  The jupyter notebook in this folder cleans the raw data set into a smaller, more easily managed tsv file.  

The cleaned tsv file was visualized in a [Tableau Public workbook](http://bit.ly/ParkingTicketsLA)
